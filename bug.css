The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but sometimes it can produce unexpected results if the units are not consistent or if there are errors in the mathematical expressions. For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` is correct, but `calc(100% - 10)` will result in an error because `10` doesn't have units.  Another potential issue lies in the order of operations within complex `calc()` expressions; it follows standard mathematical rules of precedence, which might not always be intuitive, requiring careful use of parentheses.  Finally, older browsers might have limited support for the `calc()` function, causing rendering inconsistencies across different platforms.
